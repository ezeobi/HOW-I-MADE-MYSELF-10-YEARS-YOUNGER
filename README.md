# HOW-I-MADE-MYSELF-10-YEARS-YOUNGER


Am a 50 years old man that is very healthy and younger , I have a look of someone who is a decade younger. 

In the summer I play around with friends for exercise.  


In the fall I can take run outside for exercise to keep fit. I run at the same pace with my 25 years old son . 

During the winter I make sure to bundle up when taking walk 40km  for exercise. 

When spring rolls around , I don't forget my umbrella. 

When it is summer again , I can go swimming for exercise. 

No matter what time of the year, exercise is important and I don't forget to stretch. 


I eat fruits and vegetables . It makes me to look healthy because of it's vitamins content. I eat only twice a day . 

I don't smoke because it will affect me negatively. 

I always make exercise my priority that is why am healthier and younger
